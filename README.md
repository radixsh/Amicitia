# Amicitia
Amicitia makes it easier for anyone to find members of a particular role. More specifically, I developed this bot to help students in my university Discord servers find people who shared their major. 

Add Amicitia to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=853056741969362966&permissions=2112&scope=bot).
